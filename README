# LaTeX Development Environment for Visual Studio Code

This repository contains a development environment for LaTeX that can be used with Visual Studio Code. It includes a `.devcontainer` configuration that sets up a Docker container with a full TeX Live installation, and it automatically installs the LaTeX Workshop extension in Visual Studio Code.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code
- Docker

## Usage

1. Clone this repository, or simply copy the `.devcontainer` directory to your project.
2. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code.
3. When prompted, choose to reopen the project in the container. If you're not prompted, press `F1`, type `Reopen in Container`, and hit `Enter`.

Once the container is running, you can start editing your LaTeX files in Visual Studio Code. The LaTeX Workshop extension provides a rich editing experience with features like syntax highlighting, document formatting, and build automation.

## LaTeX Workshop Extension

The LaTeX Workshop extension enhances the LaTeX editing experience in Visual Studio Code. It provides features like building LaTeX projects, viewing PDF files, and autocompletion for LaTeX commands.

## Other Extensions

Feel free to add or remove the other extensions from the devcontainer. The extensions currently are:

- vscode icons: Bring real icons to your Visual Studio Code
- gitlens: GitLens supercharges your Git experience in VS Code
- trailing spaces: Highlight trailing spaces and delete them in a flash!
- latex utilities: An add-on to LaTeX Workshop that provides some fancy features
